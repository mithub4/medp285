                        Matcha Health Benefits</a>
                    </h2>

                    <p> Matcha tea has received a lot of health buzz over the years and for a good reason – this
                        powdered variety of green tea is packed with nutrition benefits. Since it is highly
                        concentrated, it may have three times the antioxidant power of regular green tea, says Shayna
                        Komar, RD, LD, a licensed and registered dietitian at Thomas F. Chapman Family Cancer Wellness
                        at Piedmont.
                        <br><br>
                        According to Komar, studies have found that matcha:
                        <br><br>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Is high in cancer-fighting antioxidants, particularly the catechin epigallocatechin gallate
                            (EGCG)</li>
                        <li>Contains fiber, which promotes healthy digestion</li>
                        <li>Contains vitamin C, chromium, magnesium, selenium and zinc</li>
                        <li>May help reduce blood sugar and cholesterol</li>
                        <li>May boost the metabolism to help you burn more calories</li>
                        <li>May improve your mood</li>

                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Matcha has a different flavor than traditional green tea because it is made from tea leaves that are
                    ground into a fine powder. Traditional green tea is made from tea leaves, veins and stems.
                    <br><br>
                    “Due to the high chlorophyll and amino acid content, matcha is aromatic and has a unique vegetal
                    taste and a lingering sweet aftertaste,” Komar says.

                    <p> Rocky's Matcha is excited to offer our ceremonial grade blend of matcha. This signature blend
                        consists of four different cultivars including Okumidori, Saemidori, Okuyutaka, and Tsuyuhikari.
                        Our ceremonial grade blend comes from Yame, Japan where the matcha is known to taste differently
                        than traditional matcha from Uji, Japan.
                        <br><br>
                        Our ceremonial grade blend is rich and savory and boasts a beautiful green color. We recommend
                        our ceremonial grade blend for everyday matcha drinkers and it's our favorite matcha to use for
                        matcha lattes.

                    <p> Our recommendation for people new to our matcha, Sayaka is a more light-hearted, smooth tea in
                        the rich category. Its sweetness and umami are accompanied by a hint of bitterness.
                        <br><br>
                        We recommend Sayaka for your first taste of Ippodo matcha, as it is a smooth blend with umami
                        and just a hint of astringency. Try this matcha as koicha to experience the full depth and
                        nuances of its character. As usucha, Sayaka is an accessible tea to serve to beginners and
                        connoisseurs alike at teatime. For matcha lattes, we usually recommend a medium-to-light
                        category matcha with more astringency, but some will choose Sayaka for its bright color, umami,
                        and soft astringency.
