            <blockquote>
            The collection now has a number of different, red-fleshed varieties for further research. Not all of these may necessarily be accepted as perry pears. In common with most pears, there appear to be two forms, the early ripening softer, and the later ripening harder types. In Britain these are generally referred to as Blood the earlier type and Beetroot, the later ripeners. In Germany and Austria, the earlier are called Sommerblutbirne, and later ripening Blutbirne. We have both these in the collection, but some have yet to fruit. In Denmark the equivalent early type is known as Rød pære. The Sanguinole is an early, red-fleshed pear of some antiquity now found in many parts of Europe. It appears to have originated in Italy. Edward Bunyard mentions that it could still be found in some cider orchards.

            The National Perry Pear Centre has for a long time, drawn attention to the potential genetic value of local varieties, both on account of their resistance to many pests and diseases and for their possible contribution to the challenges of climate change. This Italian report also highlights the potential that red-fleshed pears might have to contribute to our own health and wellbeing! Anthocyanins are responsible for most of the red, blue and purple colours in fruits and are particularly abundant in berries, red grapes and red wine. The report also revealed that the later ripening Cocomerina pear in particular also had high anthocyanin levels in both its skin and flesh considerably greater than in the earlier ripening variety. The consumption of products rich in anthocyanins has been shown to be associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases. Anthocyanins also display inhibitory effects on the growth of some cancer cells.

            In this country, the earliest reference found to red-fleshed pears is in John Parkinson’s Paradisi in Sole, Paradisus Terrestris of 1629, where he refers to the Blood Red Pear having a dark red colour on the outside but piercing very little into the inner pulp. John Rea in Flora, Ceres & Pomona 1665 refers to the Bloudy Pear, helpfully describing that although small and brown on the outside and blood red within. The Bloody Pear mentioned by John Worlidge in Vinetum Britaannicum 1691 does not describe the colour of the flesh, but that it has red juice. In 1752, Philip Miller in The Gardener’s Dictionary refers to Choak Pear so acrid that it produces a choking sensation, whose flesh is red, but which is rarely cultivated. This may be the first reference to a perry pear having red flesh.

        <p>
            <blockquote>
            Red Anjou (ON-ju). Juicy with fresh, sweet, and slightly tangy flavor. In season October - July.
            <br><br>

            <h2>Identifying Red Anjou</h2>

            With a silhouette identical to Green Anjous, Red Anjous (pronounced ON-ju) are just as easy to identify by their shape. Although there are other red varieties of pears available, such as Red Bartlett, Red Anjous are recognizable for their egg-shaped appearance; having a large spherical lower potion that begins a gradual and even taper above the mid-point to a smaller, rounded top. The color of Red Anjous varies from pear to pear, however, they are generally dark maroon in color, sometimes with light vertical streaks of color that were naturally created by the sun while the pear was still on the tree. Just like Starkrimson and Red Bartlett, Red Anjou pears are often simply labeled as Red Pears in the grocery store.
            <br><br>

            <h2>Seasonality</h2>

            The popularity of Red Anjous has brought a great deal of attention for this variety. Planting of Red Anjou pear trees in the Pacific Northwest has been on the increase, and they can now be found in markets from late September or early October through the summer months.
            Red Anjous show only slight change in color as they ripen, which is another characteristic shared with their Green Anjou counterparts. The best indication of ripeness for any pear is the thumb test: gentle thumb pressure near the stem will yield slightly when the pear is ripe.
            Red Anjous, like all pears, ripen when held at room temperature. Depending on their level of ripeness when purchased, it may take several days before they are ready to eat. The results, however, are well worth the wait. Red Anjous develop a mild, sweet flavor with very smooth texture and abundant juices when ripe.
            <br><br>

            <h2>Beautiful Red Displays</h2>

            Although they share most characteristics with Green Anjous, Red Anjous do possess one very distinctive appeal - their color. Displayed in a fruit bowl or basket on a counter or as a table centerpiece, their color sets a brilliant tone. Consider a full display of Red Anjous for Valentines Day. During the winter holidays, combine Red and Green Anjous to create a display with the appropriate colors of the season. Because their red color is only skin deep, you'll notice no difference in cooking with Red Anjous than using Green Anjous if the recipe calls for peeling the pears. However, in a recipe calling for fresh pears (if leaving the skin on) the red color can add striking contrast and eye appeal. Consider a garden green salad tossed with slices of Red Anjou pears!

            <h2>The History of Red Anjou</h2>

            Red Anjous originated as naturally occurring bud sports found on Green Anjou trees. "Bud sports" are spontaneous, naturally occurring transformations that crop up on trees, and they are most often unnoticed. Red Anjous, however, are an exception. Actually, they are an exception that occurred twice, as the first red sport of Anjou was discovered in the early 1950's near Medford, Oregon, and a second red sport was discovered in the late 1970's in Parkdale, Oregon.
