                        <p> The Kesar mango was first cultivated in 1931 by Junagadh Wazir Sale Bhai and gained its name
                            from the Nawab of Junagadh, inspired by its saffron-colored pulp. It is India’s second-most
                            exported mango variety and is prized for its rich, sweet flavor. Though native to Gujarat,
                            it also grows well in climates like South Florida.

                        <h3>Alphonso</h3>

                        <p> The Alphonso mango is named after Afonso de Albuquerque, a Portuguese viceroy, and was
                            developed through grafting techniques introduced by Jesuit missionaries in Goa. By the
                            mid-1500s, Alphonsos were cultivated in Portuguese Bombay and presented to officials in Goa.
                            Known for its rich flavor and smooth texture, it is one of the most expensive mango
                            varieties and is primarily grown in the Konkan region and parts of South Gujarat.

                        <p> The Imam Pasand mango, primarily grown in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu, is
                            celebrated for its rich flavor and royal heritage. Large and fiberless with juicy, sweet
                            flesh, it offers complex notes of honey, citrus, and floral aromas. Often called the "King

                        <p> The Jakarta mango, developed in South Florida by Laurence Zill, is believed to be a hybrid
                            of the 'Bombay' and 'Kent' varieties. It produces medium-to-large, fiberless fruit with a
                            rich, sweet flavor and a distinctive resinous aroma. Though not widely commercialized, it
                            remains a favorite among mango enthusiasts and is grown in Florida home gardens.

                        <h3>Julie</h3>

                        <p> The Julie mango, introduced to the U.S. in the 1910s by Lawrence Zill, originates from the
                            West Indies, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. Known for its rich, sweet flavor and vibrant
                            tropical aroma, it is a small to medium-sized fruit with a yellow-orange skin and deep
                            orange, fiberless flesh. Its compact tree makes it ideal for home gardens, though it
                            requires care to prevent fungal diseases like Anthracnose.
